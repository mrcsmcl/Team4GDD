# Plot
- Leo and Vinny get a new lead on how to further hurt the company by not quite going directly at the source, their headquarters, but instead finding a way to hurt them significantly by striking them where it hurts, their hard drives. Of course, NeoTech has so much information metaphorically and literally at their fingertips that they need entire warehouses filled with hard drives of that information, literally entire stories tall to say nothing of all the security measures and places where physical guards patrol regularly. Leo and Vinny, of course, can't just take all of it, and if they could, they'd have no way to review all of it, so they need to find specific pieces of information for Leo to take and bring out of the area intact.

# Level Design
- Potential for multiple buildings, all massive, several stories high (or even below) filled with banks of hard drives of their abundant information.
- Beginning requires going through a major entrance, either with the help of Vinny forging an identity for Leo (which is, of course, quite risky), or simply going around them, but that too is quite hard as there are electrified fences, guard towers, security cameras, etc.
- Guards and security devices literally everywhere, especially inside the warehouses.
- The storage facilites are also filled with catwalks for use by guards and employees patrolling the area.
	- Employees, unlike the guards, do not attack the player, but will likely raise an alarm if they see them. There is no penalty for knocking them out as Leo doesn't use lethal tactics anyway.
- Computers in the area can be hacked into by Vinny with help from Leo, who puts a device that allows this on them, so that he can go through their logs and find the correct files they're looking for.
	- The first files may also be not encrypted, per se, but filled with codewords and file names, forcing Leo to find more computers to hack into to decipher the language used in these moments.

# Environment Design
- Possible avenues for inspiration:
	- A level in Detroit: Become Human where players must sneak into a large facility undetected.
  - Shipping warehouses and piers, common among coastal cities filled with storage containers.
  - Highly secure everyday areas, or even ones that otherwise seem like they shouldn't be this secure, unassuming on the outside.

# 3D World Hazards
- Certain areas can also be locked down if Leo is detected, also raising an alarm and forcing Vinny to use his hacking skills to break into these areas (which are, of course, very difficult) to break him out before he is surrounded.
- The literal towers of hard drives provide a limited sightline for both guards and perpetrators.
- Potential for other security countermeasures, like tear gas, knockout gas, electrical traps, and so on.

# Detected
- If Leo is detected in the real world, or Vinny is detected in the Hacker World through a backtracer, an alert state will trigger that will not abate. This isn't a game breaking moment, as the mission is always completable, but it will make the job that much harder due to the extra security and the potential for literal traps on Leo's side.
- There could also be trap-hacks for Vinny, where it doesn't actually provide useful information or skills, but will activate a backtracer if the player is not successful in beating the ensuing minigame.
