<h1>Plot</h1>
<p>Leo and Vinny have to break into a prison housing a major enemy of NeoTech who they've framed to keep silent. Not all prisons are networked, though, which means Vinny is really gonna have to rely on Leo more than ever for this plan to succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Design</h1>
<p>The level is set in a Supermax prison, which are near impossible to break out of, let alone to break into. The outside is difficult enough, with guard towers and high walls with barbed wire to ensure that Prisoners don't escape, and inside is even worse with locked doors between blocks that can only be opened through either the security rooms or access cards.</p>
<p>Predictably, there are countless other security measures, arguably not as sophisticated as those found at NeoTech personally, but not far off, either. Cameras and alarms are two such nuisances.</p>
<p>Some areas could be unlockable only through physical keys rather than keycards or hacks, forcing more activity on Leo's part.</p>
<p>On the inside, there's not only guards who will attack the player, but also prisoners who may do the very same believing they're there to bust them out as well.</p>
<p>The Prison walls, while small, also have no security and could provide a good way to break in and out if they find a way to get in there.</p>
<p>The main prisoner players must break out is in the maximum security section, not quite Death Row (which is infinitely more secure), but still.</p>
<p>The prison also has other facilities, such as a cafeteria, a common area, an infirmary, and a library.</p>
<p>Players do not need to escort the prisoner out of the cell, they just need to provide a way out of both his cell and the prison as a whole.</p>
<p>Because the prison is not networked, Leo must install remote hacking devices on multiple security systems for Vinny to assist him through unlocking areas that are connected to the prison's system.</p>
<p>Starting a prison riot by releasing prisoners en masse is a viable option, but inadviseable as it will be equally dangerous for Leo himself.</p>
