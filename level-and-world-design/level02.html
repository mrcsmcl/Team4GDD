<h1>Plot</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Leo and Vinny, in their growing quest, must now go public, but not reveal their existence to the world as a whole. They go deep into the city, filled with plenty of people who will rat them out, in order to break into the highly secure penthouse of one of their targets and find more ways to hurt NeoTech.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Level Design</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike some other levels, this one is set during the day (or at least the early night time) in the middle of the city. It does, however, have it's own inherent risks. There is a major target, an accountant within NeoTech, who is hiding in plain sight, and they need whatever information he has to continue their plans.</li>
  <li>This level is also unique in that there are civilians all over the place. They aren't hostile and won't directly impede Leo and Vinny, but they are still a threat as they will go to the guards at the first sign of trouble.<ul>
      <li>This also gives Leo a chance to hide in plain sight himself, as they won't directly confront him or immediately call for help, but if Leo threatens them (he can't kill them, like anybody else, but he can knock them out), they will, and they will typically do the same if they see Leo doing something illegal or directly threatening their fellow man (whether they are a civilian or a guard)</li>
      <li>Trying to knock out large groups of civilians is also inadviseable as others will set out to call for help and thereby put an alert state on Leo.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are also guards there, some of whom might recognize Leo, and some who might not, but will physically prevent him from entering a secure location unless he fights them or Vinny can hack into their system and print him a fake pass (this won't work with any guards who do recognize Leo).<ul>
      <li>Predictably, many of these more secure points cannot be hacked remotely and require Leo to sneak in and attach a device for this to work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Leo can either bypass the parts he can, or break into them with reckless abandon, which will of course be difficult.</li>
  <li>Security systems are present in the NeoTech Offices and especially the Penthouse.</li>
  <li>The Penthouse has larger rooms and mostly living spaces, but still security systems, especially in computers and other places that might have sensitive information.</li>
  <li>Leo has the chance to use air vents and business areas to sneak around more discreetly, but some of these may be monitored with security systems designed to go off if he goes through them.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Artistic Design</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Despite taking place at a city block, the only area players can interact with is an apartment complex that's a mix between living and corporate units, meaning there are businesses and corporate offices in there in addition to the places where people live.</li>
  <li>The NeoTech offices are, of course, bigger and nicer than the average offices or even the apartments in many cases. The biggest offender is the home of a major target, a large, luxurious penthouse reserved just for him.</li>
  <li>There are also restaurants and such at the base level of the complex, and coffee shops in other places.</li>
  <li>Potential for server rooms, though these only help to gain access to further areas of the complex.</li>
</ul>
