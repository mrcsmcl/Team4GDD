# Details of the Phases:

## 1. Prototyping Phase

* **Duration:** ~1 month (Early July 2025).
* **Objective:** Validate core gameplay concepts and establish foundational technical/artistic elements.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Finalize Game Design Document (GDD):** Consolidate all game design, narrative, and visual references.
    * **Essential Mechanics Prototyping:** Implement and test core cooperative mechanics, focusing on Leo's stealth/traversal and Vinny's Digital Realm navigation (cameras, doors, alarms) and their real-time impact on Leo's 3D environment.
    * **Tool & Pipeline Setup:** Configure Unreal Engine 5.5, GitFlow for version control, and Resilio Sync for large file storage. Establish naming conventions.
    * **Basic Concept Testing:** Rapidly test fundamental gameplay elements and role synergy.
* **Deliverables:** Consolidated GDD, functional core mechanic prototypes, configured development environment.

## 2. Pre-Production & "Vertical Slice" Phase

* **Duration:** 4 months (August 2025 – November 2025).
* **Objective:** Develop a polished "vertical slice" (Chapter 01) as an external demo showcasing final game quality.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Chapter 01 Implementation (Suburban House):** Build the demo's starting area, introducing basic movement and stealth.
    * **Essential Gameplay Mechanics Refinement:** Enhance Leo's stealth/traversal and Vinny's Digital Realm interactions, ensuring real-time synchronization and visual/audio feedback.
    * **Art & Audio Design for Demo:** Create final art assets for the Suburban House and Digital Realm (e.g., glowing data streams), ambient sounds, specific sound effects, and synchronized character dialogue.
    * **Initial AI:** Develop basic AI for Security Guards (patrols, alerts) and digital defense systems.
    * **User Interface (UI):** Create basic, minimalist UI elements for both Operative and Oracle views.
    * **Demo Polishing & Testing:** Conduct intensive testing for stability and bug fixing.
* **Deliverables:** Complete, polished, and playable "vertical slice" demo (Chapter 01).

## 3. Main Production Phase & Early Access Launch

* **Duration:** 7 months (December 2025 – June 2026).
* **Objective:** Develop initial campaign chapters (01-06) leading to an Early Access launch.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Chapter 01 (Tutorial):** Consolidate the initial simulation (Vinny's garage) as the game's tutorial, concluding with the decision to steal a Nexus 9000.
    * **Chapter 02 (Electronics Store Incursion):** Implement the first real mission with an unexpected security guard and a tense escape.
    * **Chapter 03 (Warehouse Infiltration):** Introduce a motion-activated lockdown and hidden firewall, where Vinny uses the SignalPro-X.
    * **Chapter 04 (Warehouse Consequences & Planning):** Show the aftermath of the robbery, increased ambition, and initial planning for a downtown electronics store heist.
    * **Chapter 05 (Downtown Electronics Store - Level Up):** Focus on acquiring advanced tools (CamBlocker, KeyScan, Reflector, Disruptor, LatchFreeze) using the SignalPro-X.
    * **Chapter 06 (NeoTech Crisis & Decision):** Deepen the impact of the NeoTech crisis on families, introduce the Nonexist organization, and culminate in the decision to target NeoTech (but not directly infiltrate its headquarters yet).
    * **Advanced AI Development:** Expand Security Guard behaviors, implement Player-Induced Suspicion, and Persistent Alert systems.
    * **Large-Scale Asset Production:** Create extensive 3D models, textures, animations, and sound effects for new environments and mechanics.
    * **Early Access Launch:** Release the game with Chapters 01-06 to gather community feedback.
* **Deliverables:** Early Access version with Chapters 01-06, expanded AI/gameplay systems, and functional tools/upgrades.

## 4. NeoTech Saga Development, Polishing, & Final Launch

* **Duration:** 6 months (July 2026 – December 2026).
* **Objective:** Develop the complex NeoTech chapters (07-10), focusing on infiltration, climax, and final game launch.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Chapter 07 (NeoTech Headquarters Infiltration):** First direct infiltration, involving disguises, biometric access cloning (KeyScan), and obtaining security blueprints.
    * **Chapters 08, 09, 10 (NeoTech Advance & Climax):** Progressive infiltration to the DataCore (NeoTech's heart), revealing Nonexist's agenda, with complex AI (drones, security robots, counter-hacker AI), dynamic firewalls, and intricate environments.
    * **Advanced AI & Security System Development:** Implement complex AI for Security Bots, Counter-Hacker Protocol, Dynamic Firewalls, and Failsafes.
    * **Performance Optimization:** Ensure smooth framerate, loading times, and efficient resource usage on Unreal Engine 5.5.
    * **Quality Assurance (QA) Testing:** Rigorous Alpha and Beta testing to identify and fix bugs.
    * **Gameplay Balancing:** Adjust AI difficulty, player progression, puzzles, and rewards.
    * **Localization:** Translate all text and subtitles.
    * **Final Marketing Material:** Produce launch trailers, screenshots, and promotional materials.
    * **Certification & Launch:** Prepare for platform certification and officially launch the full game.
* **Deliverables:** Final optimized and polished game (all 10 chapters), marketing materials, and official launch by December 2026.
