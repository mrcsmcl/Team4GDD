# Details of the Phases:

## 1. Pre-Production Phase: Prototyping

* **Duration:** $\sim$1 month (Early July 2025).
* **Primary Objective:** Validate core gameplay concepts, establish the technical and artistic foundations of the project, and consolidate the **Game Design Document (GDD)**.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **GDD Finalization:** Consolidate and refine descriptions of mechanics, visual references, and narrative concepts.
    * **Essential Mechanics Prototyping:** Implement and test the dual cooperative mechanics (Leo's stealth/traversal and Vinny's Digital Realm navigation) ensuring real-time influence. Establish Leo's avatar in Vinny's Digital Realm.
    * **Tool and Pipeline Setup:** Configure Unreal Engine 5.5, implement GitFlow for version control, and set up Resilio Sync for large source files. Establish file organization and naming conventions.
    * **Basic Concept Testing:** Conduct rapid tests to verify basic gameplay and the synergy between the two roles.
* **Launch Milestones:**
    * **Internal Alpha:** Early July 2025.
* **Key Deliverables:** Consolidated GDD, functional prototypes of core mechanics (Leo and Vinny), configured and operational development environment and tools.

## 2. Pre-Production Phase: Foundation / Vertical Slice

* **Duration:** 4 months (August 2025 – November 2025).
* **Primary Objective:** Develop a highly polished **vertical slice** that functions as an externally playable demo, representing the final game quality. This "slice" will focus on the initial story section (**Chapter 01**).
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Chapter 01 Implementation (Suburban House):** Build the "Suburban House" as the starting area for the demo, introducing basic movement and stealth concepts in a low-risk environment. Define visual styles for Operative's (Leo) and Oracle's (Vinny) views.
    * **Essential Gameplay Mechanics:** Refine Leo's stealth and traversal mechanics. Implement Vinny's navigation in the Digital Realm, allowing direct influence on Leo's 3D environment with visual and audio feedback.
    * **Art and Audio Design for the Demo:** Create final art assets for the Suburban House environment, characters, objects, and Digital Realm elements. Implement ambient soundtrack and specific sound effects. Implement and synchronize Leo and Vinny's voices.
    * **Initial AI:** Develop basic AI for Security Guards and digital defense systems.
    * **User Interface (UI):** Create basic interface elements.
    * **Demo Polishing and Testing:** Intensive testing to ensure stability, bug-free status, and representativeness of the final game experience.
* **Launch Milestones:**
    * **External Alpha:** Early December 2025.
* **Key Deliverables:** Complete and polished "vertical slice," functional as an externally playable demo, highlighting Chapter 01 of the narrative.

## 3. Production Phase: Discovery Saga (Early Access Content)

* **Duration:** 7 months (December 2025 – June 2026).
* **Primary Objective:** Develop the initial campaign chapters (**Chapters 01 to 06**), culminating in the launch of an **Early Access** version that covers the characters' journey up to the decision to confront NeoTech.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Chapter 01 (Suburban House Simulation and Nexus 9000 Plan):** Consolidate the initial simulation in Vinny's garage as the game's tutorial, concluding with Leo's decision to steal a Nexus 9000.
    * **Chapter 02 (Unexpected Invasion of the Nexus 9000 Electronics Store):** Implement the first real incursion, featuring an unpredicted security guard and a tense escape.
    * **Chapter 03 (Warehouse/Depot Infiltration and Unexpected Barrier):** Introduce a motion-activated "lockdown" and a hidden firewall, where Vinny acquires and utilizes the SignalPro-X.
    * **Chapter 04 (Warehouse Consequences and Ambitious Planning):** Show the aftermath of the robbery, the duo's growing ambition, and planning for a downtown electronics store heist to acquire more robust tools.
    * **Chapter 05 (Downtown Electronics Store - Level Up Mission and New Tools):** Focus on acquiring advanced tools (CamBlocker, KeyScan, Reflector, Disruptor, and LatchFreeze) using the SignalPro-X.
    * **Chapter 06 (The NeoTech Crisis and the Big Decision):** Deepen the impact of the NeoTech crisis on families, introduce the Nonexist organization, and culminate in the strategic decision to target NeoTech.
    * **Advanced AI Development for Generic NPCs:** Refine and expand Security Guards' behaviors and Digital Defense Systems. Implement Player-Induced Suspicion and Persistent Alert systems.
    * **Large-Scale Asset Production:** Create a range of 3D models, textures, animations, and visual/sound effects for new environments and mechanics.
* **Launch Milestones:**
    * **Beta:** Late May 2026.
    * **Early Access Launch:** Late June 2026.
* **Key Deliverables:** Early Access version with Chapters 01-06 of the narrative, expanded AI and gameplay systems, and functional tools and upgrades.

## 4. Production Phase: NeoTech Saga (Final Content and Launch)

* **Duration:** 6 months (July 2026 – December 2026).
* **Primary Objective:** Develop the NeoTech chapters (**Chapters 07 to 10**), which are the most important, detailed, and complicated part of the story. This includes the infiltration of NeoTech Headquarters and the climax at the DataCore, followed by intensive polishing, optimization, and balancing for the full game launch.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Chapter 07 (Initial Infiltration of NeoTech Headquarters):** Mark the first direct infiltration into NeoTech, involving disguises, biometric access cloning (KeyScan), and obtaining security blueprints.
    * **Chapters 08, 09, 10 (NeoTech Advance and Climax):** Implement the most elaborate and challenging chapters, focusing on progressive infiltration to the DataCore, revealing Nonexist's agenda and Vinny's final choice. This will involve more complex AI (drones, security robots, counter-hacker AI), more complex firewall puzzles, and intricate environments.
    * **Advanced AI and Security System Development:** Implement the more complex AI for "Security Bots," "Counter-Hacker Protocol," "Dynamic Firewalls," and "Failsafes."
    * **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the game to ensure smooth performance in Unreal Engine 5.5.
    * **Quality Assurance (QA) Testing:** Conduct rigorous Alpha and Beta testing cycles.
    * **Gameplay Balancing:** Adjust AI difficulty, player skill progression, puzzle challenges, and reward economy.
    * **Localization:** Translate all text and subtitles into the defined target languages for launch.
    * **Final Marketing Material:** Production of launch trailers, screenshots, and promotional materials.
    * **Certification and Launch:** Prepare the game for platform certification and **launch the full game**.
