# High Concept

A two-player cooperative stealth thriller in which one player steps into the shoes of a precision operative—slipping past guards, stealing high-value tech, and executing perfect silent takedowns—while their partner serves as a remote oracle, hacking cameras, disabling alarms, and guiding every move in real time as they climb from backyard break-ins to toppling a world-dominating megacorp.

# Genre

- Cooperative Stealth Action;
- Light Hacking Simulation;
- Tactical Puzzle Elements.

# Platforms

- PC (Windows);
- Potential future ports to consoles (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S).

# Target Audience

- Players aged 16–35 who enjoy tight teamwork and stealth challenges;
- Fans of methodical action titles like Hitman and Splinter Cell;
- Gamers intrigued by hacking and digital infiltration;
- Duos looking for asymmetric roles without overwhelming sci-fi trappings.

# Visual Style

3D Environments (Operative’s View):

- Near-future urban settings circa 2030–2032—grounded, realistic architecture;
- Subtle signs of advanced tech: biometric scanners, drone patrol routes, smart windows;
- Moody, practical lighting (streetlamps, interior fixtures) to reinforce tension.

Hacker Interface (Oracle’s View):

- Clean, terminal-inspired UI with wireframe building schematics and camera feeds;
- Functional color palette—greens, blacks, grays—with occasional alert highlights in amber or red;
- Modular panels for network maps, door controls, and real-time video streams.

# Inspirations

- **Games:**  
  - *Mirror's Edge Catalyst* (map design and movement fluidity);
  - *Superhot* (stylized aesthetics and tension);
  - *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* (cooperation and communication);
  - *Hacknet* (realistic hacking simulation);
  - *This is the Game* (creepy horror/puzzle game that takes you into the world of the Deep Web).

- **Movies and Series:**  
  - *Mr. Robot*  (ambient tension, corporate overlords);
  - *Sneakers* (team-based infiltration);
  - *Enemy of the State* (surveillance tech);
  - *Inception* (creative use of environments and puzzles).

- **Real-World Tech:**
	- Modern CCTV networks;
  - IoT security devices;
   -Counter-drone measures.

# Game Summary

It’s 2031. Leo and Vinny, two childhood friends, cut their teeth on petty theft—first “borrowing” a Nexus 9000 console on a whim, then systematically upgrading their methods by repurposing stolen hardware. As their confidence swelled, so did their targets: from small tech shops to high-end retailers. But when NeoTech’s algorithmic maneuvers plunged their families—and millions worldwide—into financial ruin, the duo found new purpose.

Now they’re on a mission to cripple the megacorp’s power at its core. Leo, the consummate infiltrator, slips past biometric scanners and guard patrols to plant devices in NeoTech’s most secure facilities. Vinny, the mastermind behind the keyboard, remotely ignites every breach: overriding firewalls, looping CCTV feeds, and unlocking vault doors. Unbeknownst to Leo, Vinny’s own homegrown AI-driven hacking framework has been quietly commandeered by a shadowy syndicate called ShadeNet, whose subtle interventions have guided them straight to NeoTech—and whose true agenda remains hidden.

Together they must infiltrate NeoTech’s data core, exfiltrate the CEO’s staggering cryptocurrency fortune, and obliterate—or redistribute—the public debt ledger that binds the world. With every successful heist, Leo’s trust in Vinny deepens even as the hacker’s loyalty fractures. When the truth about ShadeNet comes to light, Vinny faces an impossible choice: betray the friend who’s risked everything by his side, or defy the only allies he’s known. The showdown at NeoTech’s vault will decide not just the fate of a corporation, but the very bond between two friends.
