# Game Title

> TBD
{.is-info}

# High Concept

A two-player cooperative stealth thriller in which one player steps into the shoes of a precision operative, slipping past guards, stealing high, value tech, and executing perfect silent takedowns, while their partner, playing as a digital avatar within a mainframe-like 2D world, hacks cameras, disables alarms, and guides every move in real time as they climb from backyard break-ins to toppling a world-dominating megacorp.

# Genre

- Cooperative Stealth Action;
- Light Hacking Simulation;
- Tactical Puzzle Elements.

# Platforms

- PC (Windows);
- Potential future ports to consoles.

# Target Audience

- Players aged 16–35 who enjoy tight teamwork and stealth challenges;
- Fans of methodical action titles like Hitman and Splinter Cell;
- Gamers intrigued by hacking and digital infiltration;
- Duos looking for asymmetric roles without overwhelming sci-fi trappings.

# Visual Style

3D Environments (Operative’s View):

- Near-future urban settings circa 2030–2035—grounded, realistic architecture;
- Subtle signs of advanced tech: biometric scanners, drone patrol routes, smart windows;
- Moody, practical lighting (streetlamps, interior fixtures) to reinforce tension.

Digital Realm (Oracle’s View):

- Stylized 2D/2.5D environment resembling a computer mainframe or circuit board.
- Elements like pathways, obstacles, and interactive objects appear as abstract blocks, circuit components, or data structures.
- A functional color palette of greens, blues, blacks, and grays, with vibrant highlights (amber, red) for alerts or interactive elements.
- Visual cues for network maps, door controls, and real-time video streams are integrated directly into the 2D environment, perhaps as pop-up screens or overlaid UI elements within the 2D world itself.

# Inspirations

- **Games:**  
  - *Mirror's Edge Catalyst* (map design and movement fluidity);
  - *Superhot* (stylized aesthetics and tension);
  - *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* (cooperation and communication);
  - *Hacknet* (realistic hacking simulation);
  - *Welcome to the Game* (creepy horror/puzzle game that takes you into the world of the Deep Web);
  - *Deus Ex: Human Revolution*;
  - *Watch_Dogs* (pretty much all about hacking);
  - *Sly Cooper* (creative hacking minigames);
  

- **Movies and Series:**  
  - *Mr. Robot*  (ambient tension, corporate overlords);
  - *Sneakers* (team-based infiltration);
  - *Enemy of the State* (surveillance tech);
  - *Inception* (creative use of environments and puzzles).
  - *24* (Fast pacing with quick computer hacking while someone else is in the field, fighting enemies);

- **Real-World Tech:**
	- Modern CCTV networks;
  - IoT security devices;
  - Counter-drone measures.

# Game Summary

It’s 2033. Leo and Vinny, two childhood friends, cut their teeth on petty theft, first “borrowing” a Nexus 9000 console on a whim, then systematically upgrading their methods by repurposing stolen hardware. As their confidence swelled, so did their targets: from small tech shops to high-end retailers. But when NeoTech’s algorithmic maneuvers plunged their families, and millions worldwide, into financial ruin, the duo found new purpose.

Now they’re on a mission to cripple the megacorp’s power at its core. Leo, the consummate infiltrator, slips past biometric scanners and guard patrols to plant devices in NeoTech’s most secure facilities. Vinny, the mastermind behind the keyboard, remotely ignites every breach: overriding firewalls, looping CCTV feeds, and unlocking vault doors. Unbeknownst to Leo, Vinny’s hacking framework has been quietly commandeered by a shadowy syndicate called Nonexist, whose subtle interventions have guided them straight to NeoTech and whose true agenda remains hidden.

Together they must infiltrate NeoTech’s data core, exfiltrate the CEO’s staggering cryptocurrency fortune, and obliterate, or redistribute, the public debt ledger that binds the world. With every successful heist, Leo’s trust in Vinny deepens even as the hacker’s loyalty fractures. When the truth about Nonexist comes to light, Vinny faces an impossible choice: betray the friend who’s risked everything by his side, or defy the only allies he’s known. The showdown at NeoTech’s vault will decide not just the fate of a corporation, but the very bond between two friends.

# Key Features


- **Online Co-op Gameplay:** 
Online or local drop-in/drop-out; voice/text comms and pings for silent coordination.

- **Operative & Oracle Roles**
**LEO** conducts on-site stealth: drone evasion, card-key snatches, silent takedowns.
**VINNY** navigates a digital world, directly interacting with nodes and systems to command the network: initiating camera loops, overriding alarms, and executing dynamic firewall exploits.

- **Escalating Mission Scale**
From backyard “training runs” to boutique tech-shop heists, up to Neotech’s fortified data core.

- **Adaptive AI Security**
Patrol drones and camera networks learn from your tactics, forcing fresh approaches each time.

- **Integrated Puzzle Layers**
Laser grids, biometric locks, network-relay puzzles that demand split-second teamwork.

- **Grounded Futurism**
Tech circa 2030–2040: plausible, tactile gadgets and interfaces, not over-the-top sci-fi.
