# Main Plot

Leo and Vinny, two childhood friends, started small in the world of crime by stealing a Nexus 9000 gaming console from a local store. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, driven more by excitement than necessity. However, the success of their initial heist fueled their confidence, leading them to progressively bigger and riskier operations. They became skilled in bypassing security systems and using stolen equipment to enhance their methods.

Their ambition grew alongside their success. They began targeting tech companies and retailers, acquiring sophisticated tools which made their heists more efficient. Over time, their goals shifted from simply surviving to amassing wealth and proving their prowess in the criminal underworld.

However, their greed started to cloud their judgment, leading to sloppier planning and near-exposures. At one point, their overconfidence brought unwanted attention to their operations, forcing them to reevaluate their approach.

A turning point came when the global megacorporation NeoTech caused widespread financial turmoil, plunging many, including their families and friends, into poverty. Witnessing their loved ones struggle and suffer reignited their sense of purpose. They decided to channel their skills toward a more significant goal: targeting NeoTech.

Unknown to Leo, Vinny secretly allied with a shadowy organization called Nonexist, which saw potential in the duo’s talents. Nonexist subtly aided their operations, ensuring their success and nudging them toward NeoTech as a target.

Now, Leo and Vinny are no longer just petty thieves; they’ve become driven individuals aiming to dismantle NeoTech’s power and wealth. Their ultimate plan is to infiltrate NeoTech’s most secure systems, steal the CEO's vast cryptocurrency fortune, and destabilize the corporation. While Leo believes they’re acting alone, he remains unaware of Nonexist’s hidden involvement in their actions.

The story has shifted from youthful ambition to a battle against a corporate giant, fueled by personal stakes and a newfound moral drive. As their heists grow bolder and the risks intensify, the question looms: how far are they willing to go, and what price will they pay for their mission?

# World and Setting

The world is set in a near-future society where technology plays a central role in everyday life, but there are still remnants of the current world’s systems. Society is divided between the elite few who control vast corporations and the majority who struggle to get by. The economy is driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, data networks, and cryptocurrencies, but inequality and oppression persist beneath the surface.

The story unfolds in an urban, cyberpunk-inspired world where neon lights flicker across towering skyscrapers, and information flows freely across the internet, yet security measures are pervasive and invasive. The streets are bustling during the day with people going about their lives, but at night, a darker world emerges—one where cybercriminals and rogue operators thrive.

## Technology and Security

The technology in this world is a blend of current advancements and speculative futurism. While AI and automation dominate corporate operations, sophisticated security measures are designed to thwart unauthorized access and cyber threats. Key technologies include:

## Societal Divide

- Elite Class: Composed of powerful executives, tech innovators, and shareholders who control global corporations like NeoTech.
- Middle Class: Struggling professionals, technicians, and tradespeople who maintain the infrastructure of society, yet face increasing inequality.
- Underworld: Comprised of rogue hackers, cybercriminals, and underground organizations like  Nonexist, who operate outside legal boundaries.

## Themes

- Inequality and Resistance: The divide between the privileged and the oppressed, where protagonists push back against oppressive systems.
- Surveillance and Privacy: The constant battle against invasive corporate and state surveillance.
- Corruption and Power: Exploring the corrupt nature of mega-corporations and the lengths individuals will go to dismantle them.

# Characters Overview
<br>

### Tab {.tabset}

#### **Leo**  

Twenty-one, geek-athletic (especially a runner), always wears headphones.

Leo has the lithe, toned physique of a runner, lean muscle, tight core, and long, springy legs that seem made to move. His posture is upright and confident, his steps light and rhythmic, like he's always ready to take off. There’s an alertness in his every movement, like his body has muscle memory of constant motion.

His skin is sun-kissed, especially on his arms and face, with a natural tan and the occasional faint freckle across the bridge of his nose and cheeks. His eyes are dark and sharp, half-shielded most of the time by the band of his over-ear headphones or the hood of his sweatshirt.

His hair is light brown, cropped short on the sides and longer on top, slightly tousled in a way that looks effortless but stylish, often damp from sweat or windblown from a run. He wears a bit of stubble on his chin and jaw, not quite intentional, but not neglected either.

Leo’s wardrobe is minimalist and athletic: breathable tech-fabric shirts, running shorts even when he’s not working out, and well-worn performance sneakers with flecks of dirt or city dust. If it’s chilly, he throws on a zip-up hoodie, often with paint stains, wear marks, or the lingering scent of pavement and fresh air.

He always wears a smart band or sports watch on his left wrist. Music is a constant companion; his fingers often tap against his thigh or twitch subtly in time with a beat only he can hear. His smile is rare, but when it comes, it’s bright and real, open and unaffected, like sunlight breaking through clouds.

#### **Vinny**  
Nerdy, early twenties, with intense, restless eyes.

Vinny has a slim build, with a slight forward hunch, the posture of someone used to hunching over books or screens for long hours. His skin is pale, with a subtle, persistent undertone of sleeplessness under his eyes, which are large, honey-brown with golden flecks, and constantly scanning, as if his brain never quite shuts off. There’s an intensity in his gaze that can feel overwhelming, like he’s always mid-thought, even when silent.

His dark brown hair is thick and slightly wavy, perpetually messy, as if he’s run his fingers through it dozens of times throughout the day — and he has. Strands fall onto his forehead without care, and he rarely bothers to brush them aside.

His face is angular, with a narrow jawline, a sharp nose, and thin lips that are often pressed together in thought or slightly bitten, a nervous habit. He wears thin-rimmed glasses that he frequently pushes up with his index finger, almost unconsciously.

Vinny dresses in layered clothes: geeky graphic T-shirts, usually under open flannel shirts, and often a heavy hoodie on top, even when it's not cold, more out of comfort than necessity. His jeans are worn at the knees, and his sneakers are scuffed and loosely tied.

His body is rarely still, fingers tap, feet fidget, one leg bounces when crossed. There's a jittery, kinetic quality to him, like his body is struggling to keep pace with his thoughts. He speaks fast, with a hint of excitement or urgency, and his eyes never settle on one place for long.

#### **Vinny’s Parents**  
Vinny’s parents are hardworking but struggling to make ends meet. His father works long hours in a factory, while his mother manages the household, caring for Vinny’s younger sister, Clara.

#### **Clara**

Though she doesn’t fully comprehend the danger Vinny puts himself in, she admires his determination and courage. Her innocence and youthful energy contrast with the dark world Vinny and Vinny navigate, and her trust in her brother motivates him to strive for a better future.
