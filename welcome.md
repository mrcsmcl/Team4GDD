# Hello and welcome to the Team and our Game Design Document Wiki!

First and foremost, we’re thrilled to have you on the team. This wiki is our central hub for references, inspiration, guidelines, and brainstorming: the place where we consolidate everything that makes our game unique and special.

Each section is designed to provide transparency to the creative process and serve as a guide for anyone who joins, whether you’re a curious newcomer or a veteran looking to align ideas.

Right now, a few areas of the GDD are still being updated, and for organizational and security reasons, access to those sections is temporarily restricted. Don’t worry: very soon every area will be unlocked, and you’ll be able to explore everything in full.

In the meantime, we invite you to dive into what’s already available: read through the mechanic descriptions, study the visual references, immerse yourself in the narrative concepts, and start forming questions, suggestions, and insights. After all, the power of our work lies in continuous collaboration!

---

Feel free to leave comments on each page, propose edits, or add any reference links you think are relevant. There’s no such thing as a bad idea, only opportunities to improve the project. The more we discuss, the more polished and consistent our design will become.

If a specific question comes up about a mechanic, naming conventions, or the visual language we’re adopting, post it directly in the comment section so everyone on the team can follow along and contribute answers.

And remember: our communication doesn’t stop at the wiki. For faster conversations, quick discussions, or even just a casual chat, hop onto our Discord channel. You’ll find everyone there, designers, programmers, artists, and producers, ready to swap ideas, share files, schedule calls, or just say hi and talk games.
