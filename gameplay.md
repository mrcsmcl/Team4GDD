# **Core Mechanics**

##  **Dual Gameplay in Cooperative Campaign**

* The **core mode** of the game is a **cooperative campaign** that requires two players to control Leo and Vinny.
    * Players collaborate to solve puzzles, bypass security systems, and complete heist objectives through synchronized gameplay across their distinct 3D and 2D environments.
    * **Cross-Dimensional Awareness:** Leo's position in the 3D world is represented by an **avatar within Vinny's 2D Digital Realm**, allowing Vinny to track Leo's movements relative to digital threats and pathways.

##  **Stealth and Physical Infiltration (Leo)**
* Leo’s mechanics emphasize stealth and physical traversal:
        * **Movement:** Crouching, sprinting, climbing, and parkour maneuvers.
        * **Visibility System:** Guards’ vision cones and dynamic shadows determine detection risk.
        * **Noise Mechanics:** Actions like running or knocking over objects can alert nearby guards.
        * **Device Attachment:** Leo can attach specialized devices to physical objects (e.g., security panels, servers) in the 3D environment, creating a digital gateway for Vinny to hack. These devices are visible to enemies and must be placed carefully to avoid detection.
        * **Information Gathering:** Leo may need to locate and identify specific **serial numbers, access codes, or physical data points** within the 3D environment for Vinny to use as input for advanced hacking operations in the Digital Realm.
        * **Guided Navigation:** Leo must follow Vinny's guidance to avoid invisible **digital barriers** (e.g., "corrupted data streams," "digital tripwires") that exist only within the 2D Digital Realm. Passing through these areas, despite no physical obstacle in the 3D world, will trigger alarms or alert digital defenses. If Vinny is wearing specific AR glasses, Leo may see a **holographic avatar of Vinny** within the 3D environment, providing visual cues for digital threats or pathways.
        * **Stealth Gameplay:** Leo is strongly encouraged to remain in stealth, and has a move that allows him to silently knock out guards and (possibly) access to stun guns. He can then drag their bodies to a location to hide them, whether it be an unscripted section or one (like a locker) where he can hide them more effectively.
        * **Combat Gameplay:** Though strongly discouraged, Leo is able to get into fights with enemies should he be found and cause an alert state. However, as he can only focus on one enemy at a time effectively (two at the most), he's encouraged to run instead as he will be easily overwhelmed and defeated. Players can block enemy strikes and throw their own in response, timing blocking with their strikes is essential to quickly end the fight, rather than just wildly flailing their arms about. A few strikes will lead to a takedown, granted that the enemy doesn't successfully block them. Players can also only block from one direction at a time, hence the possibility of being overwhelmed easily. (Reference: Dishonored and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay)
        


##  **Hacking and Digital Manipulation (Vinny)**

* Vinny operates remotely through a digital avatar within a mainframe-like 2D environment:
        * **Digital Navigation:** Vinny's avatar moves along circuit pathways, through data blocks, and across abstract representations of the 3D environment, allowing direct interaction with digital systems.
        * **Firewalls and Defenses:** Players solve puzzles within the 2D interface to disable alarms, open locked "gates" (doors), or disrupt "Watchdog" programs and other digital defense systems.
        * **Environmental Control:** Vinny can remotely manipulate certain environmental elements in Leo's 3D world, such as **turning lights on or off** within hacked power grids, or triggering minor distractions.
        * **Multitasking:** Vinny must manage time-sensitive tasks while Leo navigates physical threats, often requiring quick decision-making and precise digital interaction.
        * **Tool Upgrades:** New tools unlock as missions progress, allowing more advanced system manipulation within the Digital Realm.

##  **(Possible mechanic) Stun Guns**
* Players can utilize Stun Guns to take enemies out from a short distance, and it can also be useful in a combat situation. However, it's often not recommended as the gun can be pretty loud, leave a trace (namely some confetti that Stun Guns often shoot), and has limited ammo and takes a while to reload.
        
##  **Hacking Minigames**
* Beginnning a hack can lead to a wide variety of different minigames that need to be completed for the hack to be accessible. Each minigame has a time limit that will cause access to be denied should they fail to complete the minigame in that time.
			* **Symbol Matching Minigame:** In this minigame, Vinny is given a collection of different symbols to decipher and a variety of options that change constantly to whittle away different parts of the overall symbol.
    	* **Keyword Minigame:** In this minigame, Vinny is given an ever-changing keyword that he has to decipher, along with different letters to attempt to whittle away at the overall word before selecting the option that is the correct keyword.
    	* **Flow Minigame:** In this minigame, Vinny must match up color-coded flows to the proper endpoint.
    	* **Frogger-Type Minigame:** Playing very similar to something like Frogger, the player must guid their avatar across a flat screen, using certain moving objects for "floatation" against the endless black void while avoiding other objects that, upon contact, will kill the player and force them to start over.
    	 * **Break-Away Minigame:** In this minigame, players are required to reach an area surrounded by "breakable" material that they must break through, though some are trapped and will send the player back to the beginning (a la Minesweeper and Dig Dug). Some materials are also much stronger than others and force players to work around them in order to progress.
       * **Key-Finding Minigame:** Players must go through a maze and find the correct key to unlock an area within a given time limit, all while being chased by "Dragons" who will send them back to the beginning and change up the maze. Bringing back the incorrect key will result in an automatic failure. (reference: Adventure (1980))

    * **Hacker World Icons**

##  **Synchronization and Teamwork**

* Players must communicate and coordinate effectively, as actions in one realm directly impact the other:
        * **Example:** Vinny disables cameras and laser grids in real time in the Digital Realm as Leo sneaks through the corresponding physical areas, or guides Leo around a digital barrier that is invisible in the 3D world.
        * **Interdependent Objectives:** Many core objectives require both players to contribute their unique skills simultaneously or sequentially.
        * **Fail State:** If either player is caught (in 3D or 2D) or fails a critical task, the mission resets to the last checkpoint.
        * **Assisted Hacking:** Certain levels may have parts of them that are not hackable remotely as they are intentionally not networked. One way to circumvent this is for Leo to attach a device for Vinny to hack into it, but this requires them to of course find the part and get there safely himself so that Vinny can initiate the hack.
        
##  **3D Hacking Benefits**
* When Vinny has successfully hacked a specific section, he can then use that to help Leo in his environment through a variety of ways, but will have to unlock different tiers in order to have more sophisticated hacks.
		* Cameras:
    		* When the cameras are hacked into, Vinny can use this to prevent them from detecting Leo and thereby entering an Alert or Chase state.
    * Alarms:
				* When hacking into the alarms, Vinny can either disable them and prevent them from being used or set an alarm off in a different area to distract guards away (unless they are already in a Chase state or too soon after)
        			* Tier 1: Vinny can set off an alarm in a different area and distract nearby guards towards there until they realize it's a false alarm.
              * Tier 2: Vinny can disable an alarm as an enemy is about to set it off, thereby preventing a Chase or Alert state.
              * Tier 3: Vinny can disable all alarms permanently.
    * Locked Doors:
    			* Vinny can remotely lock or unlock certain doors that are connected to the network, which could benefit Leo in a chase moment as these doors are typically shatterproof.
          		* Tier 1: Vinny can open and close remotely locked doors.
              * Tier 2: Vinny can grant access to rooms with further restricted access (assisted by Leo), which are also much harder to break into than tier 1 doors.
              * Tier 3: Vinny can disable silent alarms that may or may not be within any of these given rooms.
     * Electricity:
     			* Vinny can shut off lights in a given area.
          			* Tier 1: Vinny can temporarily turn off the lights in a single area, allowing Leo to move around them with more limited visibility.
                * Tier 2: Vinny can now turn off lights on an entire floor, which will throw off every enemy in the area.
                * Tier 3: Vinny can permanently shut off the lights in a given area.
     * Communication:
     			* Vinny can jam the guard's communication, which may buy Leo some more time if he's knocked out a guard and they don't respond to a check in, leading the others to believe it's a simple malfunction (unless it's overused, of course).
          			* Tier 1: Vinny can send a brief, ear-piercing sound that leads guards to believe that there is a malfunction (once again, unless it is overused).
                * Tier 2: Vinny can make the feedback much more intense to the point where it even temporarily debilitates guards chasing after Leo.
                * Tier 3: Vinny can disable communications between guards altogether, thereby preventing them from calling reinforcements when they find Leo.
     * Map:
     			* Vinny can upgrade Leo's personal map in the field to better help him by showing potential locations to help along with completing the objective or even enemy positions.
          			* Tier 1: Leo can see areas of interest on his mini-map.
                * Tier 2: Leo is given guard locations that are updated every ten seconds as well as hiding places.
                * Tier 3: Leo's map gives real-time location updates on guard positions and shortcuts.

## **Player Objectives**

1.  **Primary Goals**
    * Complete high-stakes heists by:
        * Extracting sensitive data from corporate servers.
        * Sabotaging critical systems.
        * Collecting evidence against corrupt organizations.

2.  **Secondary Goals**
    * Optional challenges reward risk-taking:
        * Access hidden areas for bonus items or lore.
        * Complete missions without being detected.
        * Achieve time-based milestones in Speedrun Mode.

# **Rules and Systems**

## **Firewalls and Network Security (Vinny)**

* Hacking puzzles simulate real-world cybersecurity challenges within the 2D Digital Realm:
        * **Firewalls:** Sequential logic puzzles requiring precision and timing to open digital pathways.
        * **Encryption:** Players must decipher patterns or manipulate data streams to bypass secure systems.
        * **Server Overload:** Resource management to avoid triggering alarms or attracting digital defenses.

##  **Anti-Hacking Measures (Vinny)**

* Digital defenses escalate as missions progress:
        * **Dynamic Firewalls:** Adjust puzzles based on player behavior or previous attempts.
        * **Failsafes:** Incorrect puzzle inputs activate security measures in both the 2D and 3D worlds.
        * **Counter-Hacker Protocol:** In high-security areas or if Vinny's hacking attempts are too frequent/hasty, a specialized **counter-hacker AI** may become active. This AI can send a **backtracer** program that Vinny must quickly counteract to avoid detection or denial of access to vital systems.

##  **Security Bots and Environmental Hazards (Leo)**

* **Patrolling Security Bots:** React dynamically to noise or movement, and can be influenced by Vinny's digital manipulations.
    * **Environmental Hazards:** Laser grids, pressure-sensitive floors, and motion-activated cameras that Vinny can temporarily disable or manipulate.

##  **Active Defenses Impacting Both Players**

* Alarms and failed hacks have immediate and escalating consequences for both players:
        * **Leo’s World:** Increased guard patrols, tightened security, and potential lockdown protocols.
        * **Vinny’s World:** Puzzles become more complex and time-sensitive, with more aggressive digital defense systems appearing. Vinny can also trigger a backtracer program at virtually any time and failure to counteract it will result in an alert state for Leo.
        * **Persistent Alertness:** If Leo is detected and manages to escape, enemies in the affected area will remain on a heightened alert state for the remainder of the mission. While active pursuit may cease, their patrol patterns will be more vigilant, making subsequent stealth more challenging but still possible if no further detection occurs.
        * **Player-Induced Suspicion (Vinny's Actions):** Repeated use of certain digital distractions (e.g., flickering lights, minor alarm triggers) within a short period or a single mission will gradually raise the overall suspicion level of NPCs in Leo's environment. If this suspicion crosses a threshold, it can lead to guards actively investigating the anomaly or transitioning to a higher alert state, even without direct detection of Leo.

# **Progression and Pacing**

1.  **Skill Unlocks**
    * Players gradually unlock new abilities and tools:
        * **Leo:** Quieter movement, EMP devices, and grappling hooks.
        * **Vinny:** Faster decryption, advanced hacking tools, and access to restricted systems.

2.  **Mission Structure**
    * Early missions serve as tutorials for core mechanics, while later missions require intricate teamwork.
    * Levels grow in complexity with overlapping objectives and security systems.
    * **Randomized Elements:** To enhance replayability, certain aspects of missions, such as the **location of specific major objectives (e.g., data servers to hack, specific items to retrieve) and numerical codes or puzzle solutions, may be randomized** for each playthrough.

3.  **Level Design**
    * Each level is designed for cooperative synergy:
        * **Leo:** Navigates physical obstacles and stealth scenarios.
        * **Vinny:** Operates remotely to open paths and disable threats, with the 2D Digital Realm's layout mirroring the complexity and structure of Leo's 3D environment.

# **Challenges and Difficulty**

1.  **Dynamic Difficulty**
    * Systems adapt to player performance:
        * Struggling players encounter simpler puzzles or slower guards.
        * High-performing players face tougher AI and faster challenges.

2.  **Time Pressure**
    * Certain objectives are time-sensitive:
        * Example: Vinny must disable a system before Leo triggers an alarm.

3.  **Adaptive Guard AI**
    * Guards react dynamically to player behavior, making repetitive strategies less effective.

# **Items and Rewards**

1.  **Consumables**
    * **Leo:** Smoke bombs, EMP devices, and decoys to distract guards.
    * **Vinny:** Overclock tokens that temporarily speed up hacking tasks.

2.  **Permanent Upgrades**
    * **Leo:** Enhanced agility, quieter movement, and better equipment.
    * **Vinny:** Faster hacking speeds, access to more advanced systems, and the **ability to re-access hacks previously denied by a backtracer** after a cooldown or mini-game.

3.  **Cosmetic Rewards**
    * Players unlock unique outfits and themes for completing optional challenges.

4.  **Story Rewards**
    * Completing missions unveils character backstories and world-building details, enriching the narrative.
