# **Core Mechanics**

##  **Dual Gameplay in Cooperative Campaign**

* The **core mode** of the game is a **cooperative campaign** that requires two players to control Leo and Vinny.
    * Players collaborate to solve puzzles, bypass security systems, and complete heist objectives through synchronized gameplay across their distinct 3D and 2D environments.
    * **Cross-Dimensional Awareness:** Leo's position in the 3D world is represented by an **avatar within Vinny's 2D Digital Realm**, allowing Vinny to track Leo's movements relative to digital threats and pathways.

##  **Stealth and Physical Infiltration (Leo)**
* Leo’s mechanics emphasize stealth and physical traversal:
        * **Movement:** Crouching, sprinting, climbing, and parkour maneuvers.
        * **Visibility System:** Guards’ vision cones and dynamic shadows determine detection risk.
        * **Noise Mechanics:** Actions like running or knocking over objects can alert nearby guards.
        * **Device Attachment:** Leo can attach specialized devices to physical objects (e.g., security panels, servers) in the 3D environment, creating a digital gateway for Vinny to hack. These devices are visible to enemies and must be placed carefully to avoid detection.
        * **Information Gathering:** Leo may need to locate and identify specific **serial numbers, access codes, or physical data points** within the 3D environment for Vinny to use as input for advanced hacking operations in the Digital Realm.
        * **Guided Navigation:** Leo must follow Vinny's guidance to avoid invisible **digital barriers** (e.g., "corrupted data streams," "digital tripwires") that exist only within the 2D Digital Realm. Passing through these areas, despite no physical obstacle in the 3D world, will trigger alarms or alert digital defenses. If Vinny is wearing specific AR glasses, Leo may see a **holographic avatar of Vinny** within the 3D environment, providing visual cues for digital threats or pathways.

##  **Hacking and Digital Manipulation (Vinny)**

* Vinny operates remotely through a digital avatar within a mainframe-like 2D environment:
        * **Digital Navigation:** Vinny's avatar moves along circuit pathways, through data blocks, and across abstract representations of the 3D environment, allowing direct interaction with digital systems.
        * **Firewalls and Defenses:** Players solve puzzles within the 2D interface to disable alarms, open locked "gates" (doors), or disrupt "Watchdog" programs and other digital defense systems.
        * **Environmental Control:** Vinny can remotely manipulate certain environmental elements in Leo's 3D world, such as **turning lights on or off** within hacked power grids, or triggering minor distractions.
        * **Multitasking:** Vinny must manage time-sensitive tasks while Leo navigates physical threats, often requiring quick decision-making and precise digital interaction.
        * **Tool Upgrades:** New tools unlock as missions progress, allowing more advanced system manipulation within the Digital Realm.
        
##  **Hacking Minigames**
* Beginnning a hack can lead to a wide variety of different minigames that need to be completed for the hack to be accessible. Each minigame has a time limit that will cause access to be denied should they fail to complete the minigame in that time.
			* **Symbol Matching Minigame:** In this minigame, Vinny is given a collection of different symbols to decipher and a variety of options that change constantly to whittle away different parts of the overall symbol.
    	* **Keyword Minigame:** In this minigame, Vinny is given an ever-changing keyword that he has to decipher, along with different letters to attempt to whittle away at the overall word before selecting the option that is the correct keyword.
    	* **Flow Minigame:** In this minigame, Vinny must match up color-coded flows to the proper endpoint.
    	* **Frogger-Type Minigame:** Playing very similar to something like Frogger, the player must guid their avatar across a flat screen, using certain moving objects for "floatation" against the endless black void while avoiding other objects that, upon contact, will kill the player and force them to start over.
    	 * **Break-Away Minigame:** In this minigame, players are required to reach an area surrounded by "breakable" material that they must break through, though some are trapped and will send the player back to the beginning (a la Minesweeper and Dig Dug). Some materials are also much stronger than others and force players to work around them in order to progress.
    
    

##  **Synchronization and Teamwork**

* Players must communicate and coordinate effectively, as actions in one realm directly impact the other:
        * **Example:** Vinny disables cameras and laser grids in real time in the Digital Realm as Leo sneaks through the corresponding physical areas, or guides Leo around a digital barrier that is invisible in the 3D world.
        * **Interdependent Objectives:** Many core objectives require both players to contribute their unique skills simultaneously or sequentially.
        * **Fail State:** If either player is caught (in 3D or 2D) or fails a critical task, the mission resets to the last checkpoint.

# **Gameplay Modes**

1.  **Cooperative Campaign (Primary Mode)**
    * A story-driven experience where Leo and Vinny work together to infiltrate high-security locations.
    * The campaign features:
        * **Shared Objectives:** Both players must contribute to complete each mission.
        * **Progression:** Players unlock new tools and abilities for Leo and Vinny.

2.  **Solo Campaign (Optional)**
    * For single-player gameplay, the AI controls the secondary character:
        * Players can issue commands to the AI to perform specific tasks.

3.  **Speedrun Mode**
    * A competitive mode for experienced players:
        * Leaderboards track completion times.
        * Includes time-based objectives and optional challenges.

## **Player Objectives**

1.  **Primary Goals**
    * Complete high-stakes heists by:
        * Extracting sensitive data from corporate servers.
        * Sabotaging critical systems.
        * Collecting evidence against corrupt organizations.

2.  **Secondary Goals**
    * Optional challenges reward risk-taking:
        * Access hidden areas for bonus items or lore.
        * Complete missions without being detected.
        * Achieve time-based milestones in Speedrun Mode.

# **Rules and Systems**

## **Firewalls and Network Security (Vinny)**

* Hacking puzzles simulate real-world cybersecurity challenges within the 2D Digital Realm:
        * **Firewalls:** Sequential logic puzzles requiring precision and timing to open digital pathways.
        * **Encryption:** Players must decipher patterns or manipulate data streams to bypass secure systems.
        * **Server Overload:** Resource management to avoid triggering alarms or attracting digital defenses.

##  **Anti-Hacking Measures (Vinny)**

* Digital defenses escalate as missions progress:
        * **Dynamic Firewalls:** Adjust puzzles based on player behavior or previous attempts.
        * **Failsafes:** Incorrect puzzle inputs activate security measures in both the 2D and 3D worlds.
        * **Counter-Hacker Protocol:** In high-security areas or if Vinny's hacking attempts are too frequent/hasty, a specialized **counter-hacker AI** may become active. This AI can send a **backtracer** program that Vinny must quickly counteract to avoid detection or denial of access to vital systems.

##  **Security Bots and Environmental Hazards (Leo)**

* **Patrolling Security Bots:** React dynamically to noise or movement, and can be influenced by Vinny's digital manipulations.
    * **Environmental Hazards:** Laser grids, pressure-sensitive floors, and motion-activated cameras that Vinny can temporarily disable or manipulate.

##  **Active Defenses Impacting Both Players**

* Alarms and failed hacks have immediate and escalating consequences for both players:
        * **Leo’s World:** Increased guard patrols, tightened security, and potential lockdown protocols.
        * **Vinny’s World:** Puzzles become more complex and time-sensitive, with more aggressive digital defense systems appearing.
        * **Persistent Alertness:** If Leo is detected and manages to escape, enemies in the affected area will remain on a heightened alert state for the remainder of the mission. While active pursuit may cease, their patrol patterns will be more vigilant, making subsequent stealth more challenging but still possible if no further detection occurs.
        * **Player-Induced Suspicion (Vinny's Actions):** Repeated use of certain digital distractions (e.g., flickering lights, minor alarm triggers) within a short period or a single mission will gradually raise the overall suspicion level of NPCs in Leo's environment. If this suspicion crosses a threshold, it can lead to guards actively investigating the anomaly or transitioning to a higher alert state, even without direct detection of Leo.

# **Progression and Pacing**

1.  **Skill Unlocks**
    * Players gradually unlock new abilities and tools:
        * **Leo:** Quieter movement, EMP devices, and grappling hooks.
        * **Vinny:** Faster decryption, advanced hacking tools, and access to restricted systems.

2.  **Mission Structure**
    * Early missions serve as tutorials for core mechanics, while later missions require intricate teamwork.
    * Levels grow in complexity with overlapping objectives and security systems.
    * **Randomized Elements:** To enhance replayability, certain aspects of missions, such as the **location of specific major objectives (e.g., data servers to hack, specific items to retrieve) and numerical codes or puzzle solutions, may be randomized** for each playthrough.

3.  **Level Design**
    * Each level is designed for cooperative synergy:
        * **Leo:** Navigates physical obstacles and stealth scenarios.
        * **Vinny:** Operates remotely to open paths and disable threats, with the 2D Digital Realm's layout mirroring the complexity and structure of Leo's 3D environment.

# **Challenges and Difficulty**

1.  **Dynamic Difficulty**
    * Systems adapt to player performance:
        * Struggling players encounter simpler puzzles or slower guards.
        * High-performing players face tougher AI and faster challenges.

2.  **Time Pressure**
    * Certain objectives are time-sensitive:
        * Example: Vinny must disable a system before Leo triggers an alarm.

3.  **Adaptive Guard AI**
    * Guards react dynamically to player behavior, making repetitive strategies less effective.

# **Items and Rewards**

1.  **Consumables**
    * **Leo:** Smoke bombs, EMP devices, and decoys to distract guards.
    * **Vinny:** Overclock tokens that temporarily speed up hacking tasks.

2.  **Permanent Upgrades**
