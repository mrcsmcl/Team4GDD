The art style for the game combines **futuristic realism** for the operative's 3D world with a distinct **digital, stylized aesthetic** for the oracle's 2D mainframe environment. Each environment reflects the setting's purpose and tone, ensuring the visual design aligns with the story's progression and gameplay elements. The game’s art style focuses on creating immersive, realistic environments while maintaining a minimalistic and sleek look for interfaces and interactive elements.

# Environment Design

## General Aesthetic

* **Realistic Futurism (Operative’s View):**
    Environments should feel grounded in the near future (5-10 years ahead). Architecture and objects will feature sleek lines, advanced materials, and subtle technological advancements while maintaining a sense of familiarity.
    A focus on clean, polished surfaces, with occasional imperfections to avoid sterility.

* **Digital Realm Aesthetic (Oracle’s View):**
    A stylized 2D/2.5D representation of a computer mainframe or circuit board. This will feature abstract, block-like structures, glowing data pathways, and segmented areas simulating digital processing units.

* **Lighting:**
    Lighting in the **Operative’s View** will play a crucial role in setting the mood. Dim, soft lighting will dominate tense areas, with brighter lights highlighting important pathways or interactive objects. Neon accents and holographic displays will enhance the futuristic feel.
    In the **Digital Realm**, lighting will manifest as vibrant, glowing lines, pulsating nodes, and distinct color changes to signify data flow, active systems, and critical alerts.

## Environments by Scenario

1.  **Digital Realm (Oracle’s View):**

    * **Design:** A stylized 2D/2.5D world that visually mirrors Leo's current 3D environment, but reimagined as intricate circuit boards, flowing data streams, and abstract representations of computer components. For instance, if Leo is in a suburban house, Vinny's Digital Realm will feature a circuit layout that echoes the house's floor plan, with "rooms" stylized as logical blocks or interconnected processing units.

    * **Key Features:**

        * Interactive elements like "camera nodes" (glowing icons on circuit blocks), "alarm modules" (pulsating danger signs), and "door locks" (glowing gates) are integrated directly into the 2D landscape, with their position and shape reflecting the location of corresponding objects in the 3D world.
        * Abstract "obstacles" and "enemies" (like firewalls or antivirus programs) are represented by data blockades or animated digital entities that Vinny must navigate or hack, often corresponding to threats or barriers in the 3D environment.

    * **Visual Elements:**

        * **Color palette:** Predominantly cool tones (blues, greens, purples) for the base environment, with sharp, contrasting colors (reds, yellows, oranges) for interactive elements, alerts, and enemy presence. The color palette may subtly adapt to the visual theme of the current 3D scenario (e.g., warmer tones if Leo is in a neon-lit environment).
        * "Data streams" or "information highways" visually represented by glowing lines that Vinny traverses, connecting the various "nodes" of the circuit.
        * "Memory blocks" or "processing units" serve as the architectural foundation of the levels, with their arrangement and abstract design reflecting the structure of the 3D environment.

    * **Gameplay Design:** Vinny's movement and interaction within this 2D space directly influence Leo's 3D environment, acting as a real-time puzzle layer.

2.  **Suburban House (Operative’s View - Starting Area):**

    * **Design:**
        A modest, middle-class suburban home with modern but not overly futuristic furniture. Warm lighting and earthy tones create a sense of normalcy before the mission begins.

    * **Key Features:**

        * Family photographs, bookshelves, and plants to add realism.
        * Subtle technological upgrades, such as a smart home control panel or a robotic vacuum.

    * **Gameplay Design:**
        This area introduces players to the basics of movement and stealth in a low-stakes environment.

3.  **Café (Operative’s View):**

    * **Design:**
        A trendy urban café with a mix of sleek modern decor and rustic charm. Glass windows provide a view of a bustling street.

    * **Key Features:**
        * Interactive objects like laptops, cash registers, and coffee machines.
        * Security cameras blend into the environment.
    * **Lighting:**
        Daylight streaming through windows, with warmer tones from hanging lights.

4.  **Warehouse/Depot (Operative’s View):**

    * **Design:**
        An industrial space filled with metal shelves, crates, forklifts, and dimly lit corridors. The environment feels cold and utilitarian.

    * **Key Features:**
        * Large storage containers with numbered labels.
        * Rust and wear on metallic surfaces for added realism.
        * Security checkpoints with ID scanners.

    * **Lighting:**
        Overhead fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows, creating a tense atmosphere.

5. **Hard Drive Storage**

	  * **Design:**
 				Potentially by the water, in a place like a shipping pier. Heavy security and open areas on the outside. Inside of one of these "warehouses" (which are bigger than a normal warehouse) are literal towards of Hard Drives, multiple stories tall. Catwalks and offices are on the edges of the building while the towers are often only accessible through elevators to find a specific hard drive. Offices have computers to find specific files and where they are located.
        
    * **Key Features**
    		Several towers of Hard Drive Storage, literally filled with countless hard drives of classified information.
        Sections are labeled by the beginning and ending serial number for hard drives.
        Multiple offices for either maintenance work (which are irrelevant to the objective) or recordkeeping (which are relevant). Accessing these is essential to finding the correct hard drive.
        Guard Towers on the outside, along with security features.
        
     * **Lighting**
     Dark lighting on the outside as it's almost nighttime, often illuminated only by searchlights. Inside has more lighting, but rather harsh lighting, similar to the warehouse as it creates a harsh atmosphere. It feels like it's after hours at a regular business and the graveyard shift for the remaining guards and employees.

7.  **City Block**

* **Design:**
  	- The level takes place in a "mega block", which largely consists of one singular building with multiple functions. On the base level is something like small businesses and coffee shops and cafes (cafe design could be used here to expand the level), where there are more people going around, but the very next floor and above contain multiple different units, such as apartment housing, office space (much of which is for NeoTech), and the top floor is dedicated solely to a penthouse for the main target, his ego begin clearly reflected in the massive and intricate personal living quarters.
* **Security:**
		- While security starts off rather lax at the lower floors, with only the basics to keep businesses' assets secure, it gets more and more prominent and secure. Obviously, housing is somewhat restrictive (but only really if you break into someone's apartment directly or other restricted areas), but further up is often only accessible to specific personnel, forcing Leo and Vinny to either forge a pass for Leo to access it, use a disguise, or even use the duct system to go further forward. Even individual air ducts and such could have security systems against this specific contingency. The penthouse is easily the hardest to access as it's only reserved for the target and his personal security. The penthouse is also quite literally filled with security measures, some of which cannot be hacked remotely, which forces Leo to assist Vinny in doing so by finding the key locations.
 * **Key Features:**
    	* **Bottom Level**
      	* Several businesses both service based, like restaurants and cafes, and specialized like Credit Unions and so forth.
        - Also has some staircases for access to upper levels.
    	* **Housing Level**
      	* Contains multiple apartments of varying sizes, but usually quite open and even luxurious.
        * Some apartments house NeoTech employees of the offices above and have higher security, but also ways to steal and doctor IDs for access and information on how to hack security systems.
        * Upper floors, containing the offices, require security clearance to use the elevator (the most direct route).
     	* **Office Levels**
      	* At least two of the levels are used solely for office space, multiple cubicles and some larger offices for executives and meeting rooms for obvious reasons.
        * Presence of security personnel working directly for NeoTech, so players can't just walk in there, or will at least need a disguise to freely move about, but avoid approaching the guards directly lest they get detected.
        * The Penthouse, the final floor, is accessible by elevator only to designated security or invited personnel to the floor, which will require Vinny to commence a specific hack. Otherwise, it's accesible either from the outside, i.e. window cleaners, or the inside, i.e. ducts and maintenance which could be monitored with isolated security systems.
       * **Penthouse Level**
      	 * The Penthouse takes up nearly the entire length and width of the block, just not the height, a testament to the occupant's ego.
         * There are only a couple areas with computers whatsoever to access the information needed, but both are spread out, one being the personal home office and the other being a dedicated security room.
         * Multiple security systems all over the inside of the penthouse, including heat sensors that will set off an alarm if Leo goes in without Vinny being able to hack into it and conceal his presence.
         * Most security systems are directly wired into the dedicated security room, which itself is hard to access without detection.
         * Virtually nowhere to hide from plain sight, either, as the areas are very open and there's a nearly unbroken line of sight any which way.
* **Lighting:**
	* Set during the day, with bright lighting to complement the bustling city street and businesses nearby.
  * Lighting is much less ominous and dark, and instead replaced with the bright lights of technology and advertisements, making it feel like the player character is on display and being watched.
  * Also provides a different kind of issue with the player, as they're now largely visible and unable to hide in darkness, both metaphorically and literally.
