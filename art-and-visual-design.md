The art style for the game combines **futuristic realism** for the operative's 3D world with a distinct **digital, stylized aesthetic** for the oracle's 2D mainframe environment. Each environment reflects the setting's purpose and tone, ensuring the visual design aligns with the story's progression and gameplay elements. The game’s art style focuses on creating immersive, realistic environments while maintaining a minimalistic and sleek look for interfaces and interactive elements.

# Environment Design

## General Aesthetic

* **Realistic Futurism (Operative’s View):**
    Environments should feel grounded in the near future (5-10 years ahead). Architecture and objects will feature sleek lines, advanced materials, and subtle technological advancements while maintaining a sense of familiarity.
    A focus on clean, polished surfaces, with occasional imperfections to avoid sterility.

* **Digital Realm Aesthetic (Oracle’s View):**
    A stylized 2D/2.5D representation of a computer mainframe or circuit board. This will feature abstract, block-like structures, glowing data pathways, and segmented areas simulating digital processing units.

* **Lighting:**
    Lighting in the **Operative’s View** will play a crucial role in setting the mood. Dim, soft lighting will dominate tense areas, with brighter lights highlighting important pathways or interactive objects. Neon accents and holographic displays will enhance the futuristic feel.
    In the **Digital Realm**, lighting will manifest as vibrant, glowing lines, pulsating nodes, and distinct color changes to signify data flow, active systems, and critical alerts.

## Environments by Scenario

1.  **Digital Realm (Oracle’s View):**

    * **Design:** A stylized 2D/2.5D world that visually mirrors Leo's current 3D environment, but reimagined as intricate circuit boards, flowing data streams, and abstract representations of computer components. For instance, if Leo is in a suburban house, Vinny's Digital Realm will feature a circuit layout that echoes the house's floor plan, with "rooms" stylized as logical blocks or interconnected processing units.

    * **Key Features:**

        * Interactive elements like "camera nodes" (glowing icons on circuit blocks), "alarm modules" (pulsating danger signs), and "door locks" (glowing gates) are integrated directly into the 2D landscape, with their position and shape reflecting the location of corresponding objects in the 3D world.
        * Abstract "obstacles" and "enemies" (like firewalls or antivirus programs) are represented by data blockades or animated digital entities that Vinny must navigate or hack, often corresponding to threats or barriers in the 3D environment.

    * **Visual Elements:**

        * **Color palette:** Predominantly cool tones (blues, greens, purples) for the base environment, with sharp, contrasting colors (reds, yellows, oranges) for interactive elements, alerts, and enemy presence. The color palette may subtly adapt to the visual theme of the current 3D scenario (e.g., warmer tones if Leo is in a neon-lit environment).
        * "Data streams" or "information highways" visually represented by glowing lines that Vinny traverses, connecting the various "nodes" of the circuit.
        * "Memory blocks" or "processing units" serve as the architectural foundation of the levels, with their arrangement and abstract design reflecting the structure of the 3D environment.

    * **Gameplay Design:** Vinny's movement and interaction within this 2D space directly influence Leo's 3D environment, acting as a real-time puzzle layer.

2.  **Suburban House (Operative’s View - Starting Area):**

    * **Design:**
        A modest, middle-class suburban home with modern but not overly futuristic furniture. Warm lighting and earthy tones create a sense of normalcy before the mission begins.

    * **Key Features:**

        * Family photographs, bookshelves, and plants to add realism.
        * Subtle technological upgrades, such as a smart home control panel or a robotic vacuum.

    * **Gameplay Design:**
        This area introduces players to the basics of movement and stealth in a low-stakes environment.

3.  **Café (Operative’s View):**

    * **Design:**
        A trendy urban café with a mix of sleek modern decor and rustic charm. Glass windows provide a view of a bustling street.

    * **Key Features:**
        * Interactive objects like laptops, cash registers, and coffee machines.
        * Security cameras blend into the environment.
    * **Lighting:**
        Daylight streaming through windows, with warmer tones from hanging lights.

4.  **Warehouse/Depot (Operative’s View):**

    * **Design:**
        An industrial space filled with metal shelves, crates, forklifts, and dimly lit corridors. The environment feels cold and utilitarian.

    * **Key Features:**
        * Large storage containers with numbered labels.
        * Rust and wear on metallic surfaces for added realism.
        * Security checkpoints with ID scanners.

    * **Lighting:**
        Overhead fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows, creating a tense atmosphere.

5. **Hard Drive Storage**

	  * **Design:**
 				Potentially by the water, in a place like a shipping pier. Heavy security and open areas on the outside. Inside of one of these "warehouses" (which are bigger than a normal warehouse) are literal towards of Hard Drives, multiple stories tall. Catwalks and offices are on the edges of the building while the towers are often only accessible through elevators to find a specific hard drive. Offices have computers to find specific files and where they are located.
        
    * **Key Features**
    		Several towers of Hard Drive Storage, literally filled with countless hard drives of classified information.
        Sections are labeled by the beginning and ending serial number for hard drives.
        Multiple offices for either maintenance work (which are irrelevant to the objective) or recordkeeping (which are relevant). Accessing these is essential to finding the correct hard drive.
        Guard Towers on the outside, along with security features.
        
     * **Lighting**
     Dark lighting on the outside as it's almost nighttime, often illuminated only by searchlights. Inside has more lighting, but rather harsh lighting, similar to the warehouse as it creates a harsh atmosphere. It feels like it's after hours at a regular business and the graveyard shift for the remaining guards and employees.

6.  **NeoTech Headquarters (Operative’s View):**

    * **Lobby:**
        * **Design:** A grand, sterile area with white marble floors, glass walls, and a holographic reception desk.
        * **Key Features:** Interactive holographic directory and security desk.
        * **Lighting:** Bright, with glowing blue holograms and accent lights.

    * **Corporate Offices:**
        * **Design:** Open spaces with ergonomic furniture, glass partitions, and sleek desks with integrated touchscreens.

            * Holographic projectors and digital whiteboards.
            * Personal desk items like coffee mugs and photos.
        * **Lighting:** Cooler tones, with task lighting at individual workstations.
