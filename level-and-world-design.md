# Level Structure

1.  **Campaign-Based Progression**
    * The game is divided into a series of **missions** tied to the overarching narrative.
    * Each mission introduces new challenges, mechanics, and environments to keep gameplay fresh.
    * Levels gradually increase in complexity:
        * Early levels serve as **tutorials**, introducing players to core mechanics.
        * Mid-levels feature **multi-layered objectives** that require players to strategize.
        * Final levels push players to master the mechanics with time-critical tasks and advanced threats.
     * Each level is non-linear and has a wide variety of ways to infiltrate successfully as well as challenges that hinder them. Players can also complete objectives in any succession, with the final objective being completable to allow players to escape to the next area.

2.  **Hub System**
    * Between missions, players can access a central **safehouse hub**:
        * Upgrade gear and tools for Leo and Vinny.
        * Replay previously completed missions to attempt optional objectives.
        * View narrative progression through collectibles and lore.

# **Layout and Flow**

1.  **Branching Design with Linear Objectives**
    * Levels are designed with **multiple paths**, allowing players to choose their approach:
        * **Leo’s Path (Physical):** Focused on stealth, climbing, and infiltration within the 3D environment.
        * **Vinny’s Path (Digital):** Focused on hacking systems and manipulating the environment within the 2D Digital Realm.
        * **Interdimensional Guidance:** Vinny must also guide Leo through areas in the 3D world that contain **invisible digital barriers** (e.g., corrupted data streams, digital tripwires) that only exist and are visible in the 2D Digital Realm. Passing through these areas in 3D, without Vinny's guidance or deactivation, will trigger alarms or alert digital defenses.
    * Despite multiple paths, objectives are structured linearly to guide players towards key story beats.

2.  **Synchronized Gameplay Flow**
    * Levels are built around **key synchronization points** where Leo and Vinny’s actions intersect:
        * **Example:** Vinny disables a laser grid and simultaneously navigates Leo's 2D avatar around a digital tripwire just as Leo reaches the physical area.
        * **Dynamic Flow:** The pace alternates between tense stealth moments, puzzle-solving, and fast-paced escapes, with added complexity from the intertwined 3D and 2D hazards.

3.  **Checkpoint System**
    * Frequent checkpoints allow players to retry challenging sections without losing significant progress.
    * Checkpoints are often placed after major objectives or puzzles.

# **Puzzles and Missions**

1.  **Integrated Puzzle Design**
    * Puzzles are seamlessly embedded into the environment, requiring teamwork to solve:
        * **Leo’s Role:** Manipulating physical objects (e.g., moving crates, activating switches) and navigating physical spaces based on Vinny's digital intel.
        * **Vinny’s Role:** Hacking systems to unlock doors, disable traps, reroute energy, and proactively guide Leo away from invisible digital threats within the 2D mainframe.

2.  **Mission Types**
    * **Infiltration Missions:** Break into high-security facilities to steal data or sabotage operations.
    * **Extraction Missions:** Rescue allies or retrieve critical assets while avoiding detection.
    * **Sabotage Missions:** Disrupt operations by planting viruses or triggering system failures.

3.  **Dynamic Objectives**
    * Missions feature both primary and secondary objectives:
        * **Primary:** Required to complete the level and advance the story.
        * **Secondary:** Optional goals that unlock bonuses, like upgrades or cosmetics.

4.  **Timed Events**
    * Certain missions introduce time-sensitive tasks to increase tension:
        * **Example:** Disabling an alarm system before reinforcements arrive, or Vinny guiding Leo through a timed digital barrier before it reactivates.

# **Environments**

1.  **Thematic Diversity**
    * Each level is set in a unique location tied to the story’s progression, creating variety in visuals and gameplay challenges. Crucially, the 2D Digital Realm's layout and visual styling will mirror the architectural and thematic elements of the current 3D environment, but stylized as a circuit board or data network:
        * **Corporate Skyscrapers:** High-tech offices with cameras, laser grids, and pressure-sensitive floors in 3D; mirrored by sleek, interconnected data pathways and security node clusters in 2D.
        * **Underground Data Centers:** Dark, claustrophobic spaces filled with server racks and moving drones in 3D; mirrored by dense, tangled data cables and pulsating server blocks in 2D, potentially with digital "drones" patrolling pathways.
        * **Luxury Estates:** Lavishly designed interiors with hidden security measures and intricate layouts in 3D; mirrored by elegant, segmented digital pathways that reflect the estate's floor plan in 2D.
        * **Urban Streets:** Open areas with patrolling guards, security bots, and environmental hazards in 3D; mirrored by open data networks with patrolling "Watchdog" programs and dynamic firewall sections in 2D.

2.  **Environmental Storytelling**
    * Environments are filled with **clues and details** that expand the game’s lore:
        * Corporate documents, emails, and visual cues hint at the antagonist's plans.
        * Players can uncover the history of each location through exploration.

3.  **Interactive World Elements**
    * The environment is highly interactive, encouraging experimentation:
        * **Leo:** Can disable security cameras, sabotage guard patrols, or create distractions.
        * **Vinny:** Can manipulate lighting, disable alarms, or trigger traps to assist Leo, and also bypass or deactivate **invisible digital barriers** that impede Leo's path.

4.  **Dynamic Elements**
    * Environments react to player actions:
        * Triggering alarms leads to increased patrols or locked exits.
        * Destroying specific systems may cause power outages, opening new paths but adding risk.

5.  **Atmospheric Design**
    * Environments are designed to evoke a specific mood:
        * **Tense and Foreboding:** Dimly lit corridors and echoing sounds in data centers (3D); reflected by glitching visuals and ominous hums in the corresponding 2D circuits.
        * **Opulent and Deceptive:** Bright, polished surfaces hiding traps in luxury estates (3D); reflected by clean but complex digital pathways with hidden security measures in 2D.
        * **High-Tech and Chaotic:** Buzzing lights, holograms, and constant drone movement in skyscrapers (3D); reflected by rapid data flow and active digital defenses in 2D.

## **Example Level Flow: Corporate Data Breach**

1.  **Entry Point (Introduction)**
    * Leo infiltrates a building through the loading dock while Vinny hacks into the building’s mainframe to disable cameras. Vinny sees Leo's avatar appear in the 2D world's loading dock circuit, identifying immediate digital barriers to guide Leo around.

2.  **Midpoint (Teamwork Challenge)**
    * Vinny must solve a multi-layered puzzle to unlock a door while simultaneously directing Leo to avoid an invisible digital barrier in a hallway that would trigger a secondary alarm, all while Leo holds off patrolling guards using distractions. If Leo is using AR glasses, he sees a holographic Vinny indicating the safe path.

3.  **Climactic Moment (High Stakes)**
    * An alarm is triggered, forcing Leo to navigate a laser grid. Vinny reroutes power to open the final exit and desperately tries to deactivate a fast-approaching "Watchdog" program in the 2D realm that is directly linked to Leo's escape route, which would otherwise seal the path.

4.  **Exit (Resolution)**
    * Both players must coordinate to escape while avoiding newly deployed security bots in 3D, and Vinny managing new, randomized digital traps that appear in the 2D escape pathway.
